> oh-my-zsh can sometimes get a bit in the way, and it needs more polish, but generally it turns zsh from something which takes a lot of research and config fiddling into something that works pleasantly out of the box, and makes tweaking more straightforward

> This project is so much more than a sane set of defaults for zsh. It is a major hub of plugin development! The fact that everything is all nicely packaged as a project on github is very nice indeed. Zsh is an amazing shell, but it seems to suffer a lack of guides on how to use it. By checking out oh-my-zsh you get a really nice set of examples in which you can learn zsh

> My mouth dropped the first time I saw my new terminal with oh-my-zsh. I teach web development to students at a bootcamp. When students are struggling with the terminal, I tell them to install oh-my-zsh and struggling students start understanding it better. Its amazing themes can tell the students what directory they are in right way and what branch too
