 "oh-my-zsh is probably the only good thing I've ever done with my life." -- [[robbyrussell|http://github.com/robbyrussell]]

"oh-my-zsh is among the first things i install on any new machine I set up. It's as necessary as the shell itself." -- [[imeyer|http://github.com/imeyer]]

"oh-my-zsh can sometimes get a bit in the way, and it needs more polish, but generally it turns zsh from something which takes a lot of research and config fiddling into something that works pleasantly out of the box, and makes tweaking more straightforward"  -- [[Dieterbe|http://github.com/dieterbe]]
