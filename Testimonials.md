"This project is so much more than a sane set of defaults for zsh. It is a major hub of plugin development! The fact that everything is all nicely packaged as a project on github is very nice indeed.

By checking out oh-my-zsh you get a really nice set of examples in which you can learn zsh" -- [[Ksira|https://github.com/ksira]]
