h2. How to Submit Your Theme

We're hoping to collect a bunch of zsh prompt themes from people. Please send us yours!

Fork the project, add your theme, and send a pull request to Robby Russell. We'll evaluate it and merge if there are no problems.

h2. Screenshots of Each Theme

"Screenshots of each theme":https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u532agyv1hyash1/LS9yNESRlQ?lst (as of 2013-04-10), in OS X Terminal.app using Consolas 13pt and Pro color scheme, inside a folder containing both a git and a mercurial repo. Each screenshot displays the output of the @pwd@ command. It has shortcomings (plugins for some themes might be missing), but it offers a convenient and uniform overview of each theme. Plugins used were battery, rvm, hg prompt, among others.
