Due to the massive amount of themes bundled with OMZ, [new themes are not accepted](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/#do-not-send-us-themes). This is a list of other themes that are compatible with Oh My Zsh that live in their own separate repositories. More themes are listed in the [awesome-zsh-plugins](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins) list.

You can also use Github's search to find `*.zsh-theme` files:
[Gist zsh themes search](https://gist.github.com/search?l=Shell&q=extension%3Azsh-theme&ref=searchresults&utf8=%E2%9C%93), [GitHub zsh themes search](https://github.com/search?l=Shell&q=extension%3Azsh-theme+PS1+%7C%7C+PROMPT+&ref=searchresults&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93).

#### Docker-ZSH 
This theme is pretty much based on the 'bureau' theme. It has been extended by a `DOCKER_HOST` live view,
so that in every terminal session you see immediately which docker host is configured and where the local 
docker commands are forwarded to. 
If the `DOCKER_HOST` variable is not set in the terminal session, it's showing a green `local` text what can b
interpreted as a personal local test environment. If a remote host is defined it will show the address in `red`.
