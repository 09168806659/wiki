## A list of plugins that don't come bundled with oh-my-zsh

There is no restriction for adding your plugin into zsh bundle (unlike [themes](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/External-themes)) but the rationale for creating this page is next:
* sometimes you're not really sure if your plugin will not harm (e.g. it can break something).

### Installation
It should be clear from [this](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Customization#overriding-and-adding-plugins).

### The plugins

#### Git auto status

If you found yourself constantly typing `git status` after bunch of commands like
`git commit` and you want to avoid that, then this plugin is for you.

This plugin is a nice addition to **git_prompt_status**.

You can get it from [here](https://gist.github.com/oshybystyi/475ee7768efc03727f21).

#### Jira & Git interaction

If names of your Git branches contain Jira issue code, this modification of standard `jira` plugin is for you. It gets an issue code from current branch name and opens related issue.

You can get it from [here](https://github.com/igoradamenko/jira.plugin.zsh).

#### History Sync

GPG encrypted, Internet synchronized Zsh history using Git.

You can get it from [here](https://github.com/wulfgarpro/history-sync). 

#### Doge Say

Get a doge to repeat every command you put in!
