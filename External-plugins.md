## A list of plugins that don't come bundled with oh-my-zsh

### Installation
It should be clear from [this](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Customization#overriding-and-adding-plugins).

### The plugins

#### Git auto status

If you found yourself constantly typing `git status` after bunch of commands like
`git commit` and you want to avoid that, than this plugin is for you.

This plugin is a nice addition to **git_prompt_status**.

You can get it from [here](https://gist.github.com/oshybystyi/475ee7768efc03727f21).
