[Zsh](http://www.zsh.org) should be installed (v4.3.9 or more recent). If not pre-installed (`zsh --version` to confirm), follow the following step to make it work:
+  1. Install with your package manager of choice (ie: `sudo apt-get install zsh`)
+  2. Make sure it installed by running `zsh`
+  3. Make it your default shell: `chsh -s $(which zsh)`
+  4. Log out and back in.
